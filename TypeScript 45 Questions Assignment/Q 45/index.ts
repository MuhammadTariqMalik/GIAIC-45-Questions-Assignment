// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    manufacturer: string,
    model: string,
    color: string, ...options: [string, any][]): Object {
    let car = { manufacturer, model, color };
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => car = [key] = value);
    return car
}
