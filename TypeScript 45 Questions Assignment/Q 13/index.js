// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transportation = ["BIKE", "CAR", "AEROPLANE", "SHIP", "HELICOPTER"];
for (var index = 0; index < transportation.length; index++) {
    console.log("I Would Like To Have My Own " + transportation[index]);
}
